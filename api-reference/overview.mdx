<Note>
  Most of the time, you wonâ€™t need to interact with the API directly. Instead, you should use our offerrings through either [platform](platform.aci.dev) or [SDK](https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aci-python-sdk). 
</Note>

<Note>
  Our [SDK](https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aci-python-sdk) interacts with these APIs under the hood, but provide additional agent-centric features specifically designed for LLM-based agents.
</Note>

## Authentication
For programmatic access, the API supports API key-based authentication. You can generate an API key by creating an agent on [ACI.dev platform](platform.aci.dev).
You can then provide this API key to SDK environment variable or set it in `X-API-KEY` header if you are calling API directly.

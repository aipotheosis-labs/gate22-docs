## What is Gate22?

Gate22 is an tool-calling and unified MCP server platform created by Aipolabs that helps centrally manage, share, and secure MCP connections for your entire engineering organization.

## Why AI tool usage governance matters

MCPs (Model Context Protocols) unlock new possibilities for the AIs you are already using, but they come with vulnerabilities and can overload agent context. That's why you need a centralized hub to govern how AI tools interact with MCPs.
Gate22 is an AI governance platform that provides enterprise-grade control, security, and observability for your MCP servers.

## What can you do with Gate22?

Gate22 provides two distinct experiences tailored to different roles in your organization

### Admin View: Enterprise Control
Managers, executives, and team leaders get comprehensive control over MCP usage:

- **Function-Level Permissions --** Control access to specific MCP functions, not just entire servers
- **Team Organization --** Create teams and assign MCP access based on organizational structure
- **MCP Management --** Integrate and manage both external and internal MCP servers
- **Governance Dashboard --** Monitor usage patterns and maintain compliance

### Member View: Streamlined Access

Team members get simplified, secure access to approved MCPs

- **Unified MCP Bundles --** Combine multiple MCP servers into a single, optimized interface
- **Reduced Complexity --** Access all approved tools through just two functions: `search` and `execute`
- **Context Efficiency --** Overcome AI agent limitations without sacrificing functionality
- **Secure URLs --** Bundle URLs function like service tokens, maintaining security while enabling access

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create MCP Bundles">
    Combine multiple MCPs into a Unified MCP Server.
    Your admin has configured which MCP servers you can access. Gate22 automatically bundles them into a single, optimized Unified MCP Server using just two functions: `search` and `execute`.

    Get your unique MCP bundle URL.
    From the [Bundle MCP <Icon icon="up-right-from-square"/>](https://gate22.aci.dev/bundle-mcp) page, copy the MCP bundle URL. This URL functions like a service token and maintains all organizational security controls.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Building">
    Enable your team to create powerful AI workflows with full governance.
    Your AI assistant can now access all approved MCP functions through the unified MCP bundle. All organizational permissions and controls remain in effect, ensuring secure and compliant AI tool usage.
    <Frame>

    </Frame>

    **Example workflow:**
    ```plaintext
    "Check Sentry for any critical errors in the last hour, 
    and if found, create a Linear issue with the error details"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Using the Unified Interface

Once connected, you interact with all approved MCP servers through a simplified interface:

- **search** -- Discover available MCP functions and their capabilities
- **execute** -- Run approved functions with automatic permission enforcement

This reduces context window overhead while maintaining full governance control.

# Monitor and Govern

For Admins:
Navigate to the [Admin Console <Icon icon="up-right-from-square"/>](https://gate22.aci.dev/mcp-servers) to:

- View real-time MCP usage patterns across your organization
- Track which functions are being called and by whom
- Adjust permissions and access controls as needed

- Owned by either a user or an organization
- Contains **configured** `Apps`, `Agents` (and their API Keys), and `Linked Accounts`
- Serves as a boundary for resource management and permissions


<Note>
  A `Project` is your workspace within the platform. It's where you configure `Apps`, create and manage `Agents` (and their API Keys), and manage `Linked Accounts`. Each `Project` has its own resources and settings, allowing you to create isolated environments for different use cases or clients.

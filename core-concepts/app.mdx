## Each App:

- Has a unique name across the platform (e.g., `GITHUB`, `SLACK`, `BRAVE_SEARCH`)
- Contains a collection of related functions usable by AI agents that interact with the external service
- Supports one or more security schemes (OAuth2, API Key, etc.) for authentication
- Has metadata including description, logo, version, provider information, and categories

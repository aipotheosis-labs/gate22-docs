- Represents a specific context or purpose for accessing the platform
- Has its own API key for authentication
- Can be restricted to use only specific `Apps` (select from the list of `Configured Apps`) within the `Project`
- Can have `Custom Instructions` for how to (and how not to) use `Functions`
- Allows for a natural multi-agent architecture within a single `Project`

<Note>
  Agents are designed to support multi-agent systems. Each agent can have its own set of allowed `Apps` and `Custom Instructions`, enabling specialized behaviors. For simple use cases, you can use the default agent created for your `Project`.
</Note>


## Agent Level Access Control
For each `App` you configured, you can specify if you want to allow the agent to access that `App`.

## Custom Instructions

You can specify a `Custom Instruction` per `Function` for the `Agents` to follow. e.g.,:
- `GMAIL__SEND_EMAIL`: "Don't send emails to people outside my organization"
- `BRAVE_SEARCH__WEB_SEARCH`: "Only allowed to search the web for the following topics: [...]"
- `GITHUB__STAR_REPOSITORY`: "Don't star repositories that are not related to AI"

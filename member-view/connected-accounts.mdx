## Overview

The **Connected Accounts** tab allows you to manage your personal connections to various MCP servers and integrated services. Depending on your admin's configuration, you'll either connect your own account or use an organization-shared one.

## Account Connection Process

### Connecting Your Own Accounts

When MCP servers are set to "bring your own credentials," you'll need to connect your individual accounts:


#### Steps to Connect:
1. **Select MCP Server**: Choose the MCP server configuration you want to connect to
2. **Authentication Method**: 
   - **OAuth**: You'll be redirected to the service provider for authentication
   - **API Key**: Enter your personal API key
   - **No Authentication**: Some services don't require credentials
3. **Confirm Connection**: Complete the authentication process

### Account Types

- **Individual Developer Accounts**: Your personal accounts connected when "bring your own credentials" is configured
- **Organization-Shared Accounts**: Pre-configured accounts managed by administrators

<Note>
  The authentication method depends on how your administrator has configured each MCP server. Contact your admin if you need access to additional services or have questions about account requirements.

## Overview

The **MCP Bundles** tab shows the bundles that have been created and assigned to you. These bundles provide access to multiple MCP servers through a single, unified endpoint.

## Accessing Your Bundles

Once an MCP Bundle is created and assigned to you, you will receive a unique **MCP URL**. This URL acts as a secure service token, allowing your AI tools or IDEs to access the bundled MCP servers within the policies set by your administrator.

<Warning>
  **Treat your MCP URL as a secret.** It provides access to your bundled MCP servers and should be protected like any other sensitive credential.
</Warning>

## Important Safety Feature: Bundle Immutability

MCP Bundles are designed with a critical safety feature: **they do not auto-update**. This means:

- If underlying accounts connected to the MCP servers are removed, or if tool names change, your existing bundle will not automatically reflect these changes
- To regain access to updated tools or configurations, an administrator must explicitly **resync** the MCP tools within the bundle

This minimizes potential attack surfaces by preventing unauthorized or unintended changes to your bundle's access capabilities, ensuring a stable and secure environment for your AI agents.

## Bundle Information

<Note>
  If you need a new bundle or modifications to an existing one, or if your bundle requires a resync, please contact your organization's administrator.

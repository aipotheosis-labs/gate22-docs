## Overview

Developers see what admins have allowed them to use with IDEs, AI tools, or internal AI agents. This view shows all MCP server configurations that have been made available to your team.


## Creating Bundles

You can create **bundles** - these condense multiple MCP servers into a single endpoint with just 2 tools. This conserves context instead of dozens of tools, you get: search and execute, preventing context overload while maintaining high tool-use accuracy.

### Benefits of Bundling
- **Context Conservation**: Reduces the number of tools from dozens to just 2 (search and execute)
- **Improved Performance**: Prevents context overload in AI tools
- **High Accuracy**: Maintains tool-use accuracy while simplifying the interface
- **Unified Endpoint**: Single endpoint for multiple MCP servers

<Note>
  Only MCP servers that your admin has configured and made available to your team will appear in this list. Contact your administrator if you need access to additional services.

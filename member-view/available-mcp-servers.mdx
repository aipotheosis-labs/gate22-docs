The [ACI Python SDK <Icon icon="up-right-from-square"/>](https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aci-python-sdk) offers a convenient way to access the ACI REST API from any Python 3.10+ application.

In most cases, you should use the SDK to interact with our system programmatically unless you have a specific reason to call the API directly.

Both the SDK and API are currently in beta, so breaking changes may occur.

<Note>
SDKs for additional languages are coming soon. If you're interested in contributing to our open-source SDKs, please [reach out <Icon icon="envelope"/>](mailto:support@aipolabs.xyz)!

## Usage
**ACI.dev** is built with **agent-first** principles. Although you can call each of the APIs and use the SDK any way you prefer in your application, we strongly recommend trying the [Agent-centric <Icon icon="up-right-from-square"/>](https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aci-python-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#agent-centric-features) features and taking a look at the [agent examples <Icon icon="up-right-from-square"/>](https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aci-agents/tree/main) to get the most out of the platform and to enable the full potential and vision of future agentic applications.

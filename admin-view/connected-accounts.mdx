Function in our platform is equivalent to the concept of `Function` or `Tool` in function/tool calling.
Functions are logically grouped by the App they belong to.

## Each Function:

- Have a unique name across the platform, typically in the format `APP_NAME__FUNCTION_NAME` (e.g., "GITHUB__STAR_REPOSITORY")
- Is compatible with function calling schema of OpenAI, Anthropic etc
- Define the parameters they accept and the response they return
- Handle the communication with external services
- Inherit the authentication configuration from the App

<Note>
  Functions are the building blocks that AI agents use to interact with external services. Each function has a specific purpose, such as creating a GitHub repository or sending a Slack message.

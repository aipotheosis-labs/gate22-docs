**Custom MCP Servers** allow you to bring any remote MCP server to be managed by Gate22. While you can browse and configure from 80+ pre-configured MCP servers, custom MCP servers give you the flexibility to integrate any MCP server that isn't already available in our catalog.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to MCP Servers">
    Browse the available MCP servers list and click "Add Custom MCP Server" to open the custom MCP server modal.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter MCP Details">
    Configure your custom MCP server by entering the required information:
    - Paste the remote MCP server URL
    - Add a description for your team
    - Configure server settings

  <Step title="Set up Operational Account">
    <Warning>
      **Important**: You **must** provide an operational account when adding a custom MCP server.
    </Warning>
    
    The operational account is **only** used to retrieve tool lists from MCP servers, not by end users. This is required because:
    - Gate22 uses a search-and-execute pattern for bundles
    - Tool lists need to be embedded in our vector database ahead of time
    - Most MCP servers require authentication to return their tool lists

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect Account and Sync Tools">
    After connecting your operational account, sync the tools to retrieve all tool descriptions and embed them for dynamic search.
    
    You'll see a diff showing what tools changed every time you sync:
    - **New tools added**
    - **Removed tools** 
    - **Modified tools**

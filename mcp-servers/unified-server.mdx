## Overview

The Unified MCP Server provides a smart, scalable approach to function calling by exposing just two meta functions (tools) that can:
1. Dynamically discover the right functions (tools) based on user intent
2. Execute any function on the ACI.dev platform retrieved from the search results


## How It Works


The `Unified MCP Server` exposes two meta-functions:

1. `ACI_SEARCH_FUNCTIONS` - Discovers functions based on your intent/needs
2. `ACI_EXECUTE_FUNCTION` - Executes any function discovered by the search

</Frame>


This approach allows LLMs to first search for the right tool based on the user's needs and then execute it, without needing to list all available functions upfront.



## Benefits

- **Reduced Context Window Usage** - Instead of loading hundreds of function definitions into your LLM's context window, the unified server keeps it minimal with just two functions (tools)
- **Dynamic Discovery** - The server intelligently finds the most relevant tools for your specific task
- **Complete Function Coverage** - Access to ALL functions on the ACI.dev platform without configuration changes
- **Simplified Integration** - No need to manage multiple MCP servers for different apps or groups of functions (tools)

## Prerequisites

Before using the `Unified MCP Server`, you need to complete several setup steps on the ACI.dev platform.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your ACI.dev API Key">
    You'll need an API key from one of your ACI.dev agents. Find this in your [project setting <Icon icon="up-right-from-square"/>](https://platform.aci.dev/project-setting)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Apps">
    Navigate to the [App Store <Icon icon="up-right-from-square"/>](https://platform.aci.dev/apps) to configure the apps you want to use with your MCP servers.
    <Note>
      For more details on what is an app and how to configure it, please refer to the [App](../core-concepts/app) section.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Allowed Apps">
    In your [Project Setting <Icon icon="up-right-from-square"/>](https://platform.aci.dev/project-setting), enable the apps you want your agent to access by adding them to the `Allowed Apps` list.
    <Note>
      For more details on how and why to set allowed apps, please refer to the [Agent](../core-concepts/agent) section.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link Accounts For Each App">
    For each app you want to use, you'll need to link end-user (or your own) accounts. During account linking, you'll specify a `linked-account-owner-id` which you'll later provide when starting the MCP servers.
    <Note>
      For more details on how to link accounts and what `linked-account-owner-id` is, please refer to the [Linked Accounts](../core-concepts/linked-account) section.
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the Package">
    ```bash
    # Install uv if you don't have it already
    curl -sSf https://install.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python3 -
    pip install uv
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Integration with MCP Clients
For a more reliable experience when using the **Unified MCP Server**, we recommend using the prompt below at the start of your conversation (feel free to modify it to your liking):
```json prompt
You are a helpful assistant with access to a unlimited number of tools via two meta functions:
- ACI_SEARCH_FUNCTIONS
- ACI_EXECUTE_FUNCTION

You can use ACI_SEARCH_FUNCTIONS to find relevant, executable functionss that can help you with your task.
Once you have identified the function you need to use, you can use ACI_EXECUTE_FUNCTION to execute the function provided you have the correct input arguments.
```


<Note>
  Replace the `<LINKED_ACCOUNT_OWNER_ID>` and `<YOUR_ACI_API_KEY>` below with the `linked-account-owner-id` of your linked accounts and your ACI.dev API key respectively.

## Commandline Arguments


<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="[Optional] --allowed-apps-only">
    The `allowed-apps-only` flag is used to limit the apps/functions (tools) search (via `ACI_SEARCH_FUNCTIONS`) to only the allowed apps that are accessible to this agent (which is identified by the `ACI_API_KEY`). If not provided, the `ACI_SEARCH_FUNCTIONS` will be conducted on all apps/functions available on the ACI.dev platform.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="[Required] --linked-account-owner-id">
    The `linked-account-owner-id` is the owner ID of the linked accounts you want to use for the function execution. E.g., `--linked-account-owner-id johndoe` means that the function execution (e.g, `GMAIL__SEND_EMAIL`) will be done on behalf of the linked account of `GMAIL` app with owner ID `johndoe`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="[Optional] --transport">
    The `transport` argument is used to specify the transport protocol to use for the MCP server.
    The default transport is `stdio`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="[Optional] --port">
    The `port` argument is used to specify the port to listen on for the MCP server if the `--transport` is set to `sse`.
    The default port is `8000`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

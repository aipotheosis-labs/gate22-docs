## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP) <Icon icon="up-right-from-square"/>](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is an open standard developed by Anthropic that enables seamless integration between large language models (LLMs) and various external data sources, tools, and applications. By establishing a standardized communication framework, MCP allows AI models to access and interact with diverse resources, enhancing their functionality and contextual awareness.

### Key Benefits of MCP

- **Standardization**: MCP provides a unified protocol based on JSON-RPC 2.0 that simplifies integration with external services
- **Flexibility**: The protocol's design allows for custom integrations tailored to specific applications
- **Interoperability**: MCP ensures AI applications can interact with a wide range of data sources and tools
- **Extensibility**: New capabilities can be added without modifying the core protocol

## Gate22's MCP Implementation

Gate22 uses the **Unified MCP approach** by bundling multiple MCP servers into a single unified MCP server. This innovative architecture provides a streamlined way to access multiple services and tools through one endpoint, while maintaining full security and governance controls.

### The Unified MCP Bundle Advantage

Gate22 extends the standard MCP architecture by:

1. **Bundling**: Combine multiple MCP servers (e.g., GitHub, Notion, Linear) into a single unified endpoint
2. **Proxy Architecture**: Gate22 serves as a secure proxy layer between your AI tools and remote MCP servers
3. **Context Optimization**: Instead of exposing dozens or hundreds of tools, bundles provide just 2 meta-functions: `search` and `execute`
4. **Security & Governance**: Centralized authentication, permissions, and audit trails
5. **Scalability**: Add or remove MCP servers without reconfiguring your AI tools

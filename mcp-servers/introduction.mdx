## Overview
Apart from using ACI.dev's Apps/Functions (tools) directly via LLM function (tool) calls, we also provide two types of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that allow your MCP clients to access all Apps/Functions (tools) available on ACI.dev platform.
The codebase is open source and can be found here: [aci-mcp <Icon icon="up-right-from-square"/>](https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aci-mcp).


## Two Types of MCP Servers
- **Apps MCP Server**: This server is similar to most of the existing MCP servers out there, where it exposes a set of functions from a specific app (e.g., Gmail, Github, etc.). However, our `Apps MCP Server` allows you to include multiple apps in a single server.

- **Unified MCP Server**: This server is a dynamic server that provides two **meta** functions (tools) - `ACI_SEARCH_FUNCTIONS` and `ACI_EXECUTE_FUNCTION` to dynamically discover and execute **ANY** functions (tools) available on ACI.dev platform.

## Comparison

- **When to use the Apps MCP Server?**
  - When you know exactly what apps the LLM/Agent needs in advance.
  - When the number of apps, and therefore the associated functions, needed is relatively small. 
    <Note>
      There is no definitive answer to `what number of functions (tools) is too many?`, but the more functions (tools) you add to the model's context window, the lower the performance of the LLM function calling.
    </Note>

- **When to use the Unified MCP Server?**
  - When you don't know exactly what apps the LLM/Agent needs in advance.
  - When the number of apps and therefore the associated functions needed is large.
  - When you want all future apps added to ACI.dev to be discoverable by your LLM/Agent without having to update the MCP command.

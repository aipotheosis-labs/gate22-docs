title: 'Apps MCP Server'
description: 'Direct access to functions from specific apps you pre-select, with multi-app support in a single server.'

## Overview

The `Apps MCP Server` provides direct access to functions (tools) from specific app(s) you select. Unlike most MCP servers that are bound to a single app, this server allows you to combine multiple apps in one server.

## Benefits

- **Multi-App Support** - Include functions from multiple apps in a single MCP server
- **Direct Function Access** - Functions appear directly in the LLM's tool list without discovery steps (Which usually have better performance if your usecase is very specific)
- **Selective Inclusion** - Only include the Apps whose functions you want to expose
- **Reduced Server Management** - No need to run multiple MCP servers for different apps
- **Familiar Pattern** - Similar to traditional MCP server concept but with multi-app capability

## How It Works

The Apps MCP Server directly exposes the functions (tools) from the apps you specify with the `--apps` parameter. When an MCP client interacts with this server, all functions from the specified apps will be available in its tool list.

This approach differs from the `Unified MCP Server` in that there's no dynamic discovery process - all function (tool) definitions are directly available to MCP clients.

<Note>
  Unlike most MCP servers that are limited to a single app, the `Apps MCP Server` allows you to combine functions from multiple apps in a single server, reducing the number of servers you need to manage.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `Apps MCP Server`, you need to complete several setup steps on the ACI.dev platform.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your ACI.dev API Key">
    You'll need an API key from one of your ACI.dev agents. Find this in your [project setting <Icon icon="up-right-from-square"/>](https://platform.aci.dev/project-setting)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Apps">
    Navigate to the [App Store <Icon icon="up-right-from-square"/>](https://platform.aci.dev/apps) to configure the apps you want to use with your MCP servers.
    <Note>
      For more details on what is an app and how to configure it, please refer to the [App](../core-concepts/app) section.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Allowed Apps">
    In your [Project Setting <Icon icon="up-right-from-square"/>](https://platform.aci.dev/project-setting), enable the apps you want your agent to access by adding them to the `Allowed Apps` list.
    <Note>
      For more details on how and why to set allowed apps, please refer to the [Agent](../core-concepts/agent) section.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link Accounts For Each App">
    For each app you want to use, you'll need to link end-user (or your own) accounts. During account linking, you'll specify a `linked-account-owner-id` which you'll later provide when starting the MCP servers.
    <Note>
      For more details on how to link accounts and what `linked-account-owner-id` is, please refer to the [Linked Accounts](../core-concepts/linked-account) section.
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the Package">
    ```bash
    # Install uv if you don't have it already
    curl -sSf https://install.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python3 -
    pip install uv
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>



## Integration with MCP Clients
<Note>
  - Replace the `<LINKED_ACCOUNT_OWNER_ID>` and `<YOUR_ACI_API_KEY>` below with the `linked-account-owner-id` of your linked accounts and your ACI.dev API key respectively.
  - Replace `<APP_1>,<APP_2>,...` with the apps you set as allowed for your agent in the [Project Setting <Icon icon="up-right-from-square"/>](https://platform.aci.dev/project-setting).

## Commandline Arguments

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="[Required] --apps">
    The `apps` argument is used to specify the apps you want to use with your MCP server. E.g., `--apps GMAIL,BRAVE,GITHUB` means that the MCP server will only access and expose the functions (tools) from `GMAIL`, `BRAVE` and `GITHUB` apps.
    <Note>
      The apps must be configured and enabled first.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="[Required] --linked-account-owner-id">
    The `linked-account-owner-id` is the owner ID of the linked accounts you want to use for the function execution. E.g., `--linked-account-owner-id johndoe` means that the function execution (e.g, `GMAIL__SEND_EMAIL`) will be done on behalf of the linked account of `GMAIL` app with owner ID `johndoe`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="[Optional] --transport">
    The `transport` argument is used to specify the transport protocol to use for the MCP server.
    The default transport is `stdio`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="[Optional] --port">
    The `port` argument is used to specify the port to listen on for the MCP server if the `--transport` is set to `sse`.
    The default port is `8000`.

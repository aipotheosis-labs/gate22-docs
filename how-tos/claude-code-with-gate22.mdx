## Overview

This guide walks you through connecting Claude Code CLI to your Gate22 unified MCP server.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Claude Code CLI installed on your machine
- A Gate22 account with at least one configured MCP bundle

## Step 1: Get Your MCP Bundle URL

1. Navigate to your MCP Bundles in the Gate22 dashboard
2. Click on the bundle you want to connect
3. Copy the MCP URL displayed

## Step 2: Add Gate22 Server to Claude Code

### Method 1: Using CLI Command (Recommended)

Use the `claude mcp add` command to configure your Gate22 bundle:

```bash
claude mcp add -t http gate22 https://mcp.aci.dev/gateway/mcp?bundle_key=YOUR_BUNDLE_KEY_HERE
```

Replace `YOUR_BUNDLE_KEY_HERE` with your actual MCP bundle URL from Step 1.

### Method 2: Direct Configuration File

Alternatively, you can directly edit the Claude Code configuration file:

**Location:** `~/.claude.json`

Add this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gate22": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.aci.dev/gateway/mcp?bundle_key=YOUR_BUNDLE_KEY_HERE"
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Verify Claude Code has access to the Gate22 server

1. Start Claude Code and use the `/mcp` command
2. You should see the newly added Gate22 MCP server

## Step 4: Test Your Gate22 Bundle

In Claude Code, use the `/mcp` command - you should see that the Gate22 server is "âœ” connected":

Test the Gate22 tools by asking:

```
Search all the available functions in my Gate22 integration
```

Verify Claude's response matches your expectation and that it can access the tools from your configured MCP servers.

## Step 2: Configure MCP in Cursor

1. Open Cursor and go to Settings (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
2. Navigate to "Tools & MCP"
3. Click "Add New MCP Server"
4. Paste the MCP configuration in the JSON format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gate22": {
      "url": "https://mcp.aci.dev/gateway/mcp?bundle_key=YOUR_BUNDLE_KEY_HERE"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_BUNDLE_KEY_HERE` with your actual MCP bundle URL from Step 1.

## Step 3: Verify the Connection

1. Restart Cursor to ensure the MCP server is loaded
2. Open a new chat or use the AI assistant
4. Test the connection by asking:

```
Search all the available functions in my Gate22 integration
```

5. Verify the response matches your expectations and that Cursor can access the tools from your configured MCP servers.
